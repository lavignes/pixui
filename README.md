PIXUI is an experiment in creating an extremely minimalistic IMGUI library.

PIXUI:
* Operates entirely in 2D. Only requiring an interface to draw colors
to a raster.
* Is internally implemented as an immediate-mode library. Layout and rendering
is done in ~2 passes with zero retained state.
* Supports variable width PCF and BDF bitmap fonts.
* Elegant event-handling and response "system". See THEORY below.

THEORY:
* TODO
